# Code Refracting
## About the project:
This project is revolved around code refracting. When given a on the job ticket, it is vital to be preapred to fix the situation. I took the old code which is best known as the starter code and improved it. Although I did improve the code I have not changed what the application does, the purpose of improvements is to make sure the accessibility of the application is up to standards. A few of the links had to be updated with new code to function correctly. If another developer was to add to this project or analyze it- the task wouldn't be to complex. The CSS styling page being structured and independent of the html page makes the code easier to understand and fix if needed. The semantic structure of the html document will make the code clear and clean.
